      stores data from surfaces (vertices) and volumes (voxels)
      concurrently in a single file comprising a listed set of <a
        href="../Brainordinate/Brainordinate.html"><u><b>brainordinates</b></u></a>.&nbsp;A

      CIFTI file can contain multiple&nbsp;non-overlapping&nbsp;volume
      components with different structures, where each&nbsp;volume
      component is any selected list of voxels (e.g., only left thalamus
      voxels). &nbsp;These components need not fill the entire grid of
      ‘N x M x O’ volumetric dimensions.&nbsp; A CIFTI file can also
      include multiple surface components with different structures
      (most commonly, the left and right cerebral cortex), but the
      surface geometry is not specified in the CIFTI file (commonly, the
      geometry is in a separate <a href="../GIFTI/GIFTI.html"><u><b>GIFTI</b></u></a>
      surface file). See <a href="http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cifti/"
        class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cifti/</a>
      for a detailed exposition of the CIFTI-2 file format.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font face="Calibri">CIFTI files are based on the <a
        href="../NIFTI/NIFTI.html"><u><b>NIFTI</b></u></a>-2 file format
      and therefore have a filename extension ending in .nii.
      &nbsp;Workbench currently supports many types of CIFTI files,
      including dense scalar (*.dscalar.nii), dense data series
      (*.dtseries.nii), dense connectome (*.dconn.nii), and dense label
      (*.dlabel.nii), where the term 'dense' refers to having a value at
      each listed brainordinate (as opposed to a parcellated file such
      as *.ptseries.nii, where each value is shared across many
      brainordinates). Files in the now-deprecated CIFTI-1 format are
      still supported by Workbench and can be converted to CIFTI-2
      using: wb_command -file-convert -cifti-version-convert.</font><br>
