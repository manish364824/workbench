    <h1> Charting Overview</h1>
    <br>
    With the release of 1.3.0, charting has been completely revised. The
    previous version of charting is still available by selecting the
    Chart Old in Toolbar-&gt;View.&nbsp; Any scenes created with the
    older version of charting should display correctly in Chart
    Old.&nbsp; In addition, wb_view will attempt to convert old versions
    of charting to the new charting functionality.<br>
    <br>
    Charting has expanded to include the display of histograms in
    addition to the pre-existing support for matrices and line-series
    data.&nbsp; An important feature of Charting is the simultaneous
    display of multiple charts for the selected chart type. In the
    Toolbar, the Chart Layers tab provides the selection of charts, as
    layers, similar to Layers used in the Overlays for surfaces and
    volumes.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Histogram Charts</h2>
    <br>
    Histogram charts are available for any data file that contain one or
    more maps of scalar data and this includes many CIFTI file types,
    GIFTI metric files, and volume files.&nbsp; A histogram shows the
    distribution of data within a single map with an option to average
    the data from all maps.&nbsp; This map contain the same data that is
    mapped to brainordinates in surface and volume views.&nbsp; To view
    a histogram chart, change Toolbar-&gt;View mode to Chart and select
    Histogram in Toolbar-&gt;Chart Type.&nbsp; In Toolbox-&gt;Chart
    Layers, enable an overlay using an On checkbox and then choose a
    file and map for display as a histogram.&nbsp; Multiple histograms
    can be displayed using multiple layers.&nbsp; When displaying more
    than one histogram, one may want to change the histogram chart from
    Bars to Envelope by clicking the Layer's wrench button, selecting
    the Palette tab, and selecting the appropriate check boxes in the
    Histogram section.&nbsp; There are a variety of additional options
    for controlling the display of histograms.<br>

    <h2>Line-Series Charts</h2>
    <br>
    Line-Series charts are available for most data files that contain
    multiple maps of scalar data.&nbsp; A line-series chart shows one
    data element from each map for a selected brainordinate (surface
    vertex or volume voxel).&nbsp; To display line-series charts from a
    data-file, one must enable the layer by checking the On checkbox and
    enable loading of line charts from the data-file by checking the
    Load checkbox.&nbsp; Note that the Load checkbox is a property of
    the file so if the same file is in more than one layer, the Load
    checkbox will maintain the same checked status in these
    layers.&nbsp; Once loading is enabled for a file, one must identify
    brainordinates by clicking the mouse on a surface vertex or a volume
    voxel.&nbsp; Doing so will load the data for the selected
    brainordinate and display the data as a line-chart.&nbsp; A history
    of line-charts loaded from a data file is available on in the Lines
    section of the Overlay and Map Settings dialog (click the Wrench
    button in the row containing the layer).&nbsp; One sets the number
    of chart lines displayed along with editing properties that include
    the color and thickness of the chart lines.<br>

    <br>
    <h2>Matrix Charts</h2>
    <br>
    Matrix charts are available for a limited number of files that
    contain parcellated connectivity.&nbsp; By default the full matrix
    is displayed.&nbsp; If the matrix is square (number of rows in the
    data file matches the number of columns) a button in the Layer
    controls the display of the matrix as the full matrix or the lower
    or upper quadrant.&nbsp; The palette mapping for coloring the matrix
    is identical to that used for display of the file's data in surface
    and volume overlays.<br>
