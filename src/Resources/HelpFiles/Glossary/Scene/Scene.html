      </font></b><font face="Calibri">Scene refers to the current state
      (settings and files being visualized) within Workbench.&nbsp; </font><font
      face="Calibri"><font face="Calibri">These settings</font> can be
      saved globally, in a scene file, which allows the user to
      re-access the current Workbench session at a later time.&nbsp;
      Several scenes can be saved within a scenes file. By reopening a
      saved scene file into Workbench, the user can "pick up where they
      left off." For more information on creating, using, and editing
      scenes, see <a href="../../Scenes_Window/Scenes_Window.html"><u><b>Scenes
