        NIFTI file (*.nii and *nii.gz) is standard file format for
        volumetric data that is widely used in neuroimaging.&nbsp; The
        original NIFTI-1 file format was based on 16-bit signed integers
        and was limited to 32,767 in each dimension.&nbsp; The NIFTI-2
        format (<a

        is based on 64-bit integers and can handle very large volumes
        and matrices.</font><br>
