Connectome Workbench requires QT4 to compile.  Recommended is the latest 4.8.x release.  The following configure options were used on linux for our builds:

-system-zlib -webkit -qt-libmng -qt-libpng -qt-libtiff -qt-libjpeg -nomake demos -nomake examples -no-qt3support -no-dbus -opensource -exceptions -stl -no-multimedia -no-phonon -no-audio-backend -openssl

Optionally, it can use OSMesa, which allows the -show-scene command to work.  Use it by setting OSMESA_DIR as an environment variable, such that $OSMESA_DIR/include/GL/osmesa.h exists, before running cmake.

It is compiled using cmake, on linux do:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
#OR
cmake-gui ../src
make [-j cores]

For other OSes, see http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html

You may want to set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release or Debug before building, as the default build behavior may be non-optimized and without debug symbols.

This produces 3 executables, 2 of which are useful to the end user (Desktop/workbench, CommandLine/wb_command), and one for running internal tests (Tests/test_driver).

To run the (few) tests available:

ctest
#OR
make test

To install workbench and wb_command with the prefix configured in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

make install

It should be noted that wb_import, provided in the HCP binary releases of Connectome Workbench, is actually part of caret5 (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download).
